# R shiny Dashboard visualisation Challenge

This repository contains Data Visualisation Hackathon 2019 winning app from our team.

The Hackathon app with cleaned-up afterward, streamlined and professionalised version, which forms the starting point of the post-hackathon project.

I hope this is a shining example of good practice, let me know if you see anything I could be doing better!

Please note that due to the commercial nature of the data used for the hackathon, the data in both app versions has been replaced with a dummy dataset for the purpose of sharing the app code.
